# SocketProgramming-Java
A simple Java Program to connect a server to a client and create and transfer image data after conversion into Byte stream.
Problem Statement
Write a program that involves a client and a server. 
The client sends server 4 values, for example X, n, B, C where, X is the adjacency matrix of a directed graph with m nodes (letâ€™s say 5 nodes: A B C D E), and n is the length of the path from node B to node C. 
The server responds back with two responses: 
  i. Positive Y response (or Negative N response) if there exists (or doesn't exist) a path of length n from B to C. 
  ii. The image of the directed graph with nodes proving the validity of the response. 
For simplicity, assume that the above graph can have minimum 3 nodes and maximum 10 nodes
